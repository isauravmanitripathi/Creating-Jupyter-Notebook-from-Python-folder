i want you to write a python program which does the following things:
1. Ask for a path to a folder
2. Read all files inside the folder
3. Then find only the python file just the .py file. Nothing else.
4. After that it reads through those python file systematically.
5. Extract all of the functions and classes from the python file.
6. Then we start putting those extracted function into a code cell inside the jupyter notebook.
7. It does this for all files only python file.
8. It stores the notebook in the same folder

Do you understand?
